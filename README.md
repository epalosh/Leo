# **Leo the Survey Bot ðŸ¤–**

**Leo** is a dorm room survey bot that invites passersby to vote on daily "this or that" questions, adding an interactive and fun element to dorm life! Mounted on the door, Leo displays a question each day, collects votes in real-time, and immediately updates the display after a vote is registered.

This project was inspired by door-mounted whiteboards that people in my dorm would put similar "this or that" quizzes on each day!

Leo is designed with an Arduino microcontroller and a simple interface that makes participation easy.

## âœ¨ **Features**

- **Daily Question Display**: Shows a unique "this or that" question every day.
- **Real-Time Voting**: Passersby can vote using buttons mounted on the device.
- **Instant Feedback**: Displays the updated vote tally right after each vote.
- **Vote Persistence**: Saves votes to EEPROM, persisting power loss or tampering.
